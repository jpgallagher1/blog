I wanted to try making some machine learning programs that can draw.  I am a visual person and I enjoy building things.  I'm going to try and make a generative model that can draw an eagle.  I'm going to track the coding journey through several posts. 

I first saw an article posted [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/image-generator-drawing-cartoons-with-generative-adversarial-networks-45e814ca9b6b).  I want to replicate this process and make pictures of eagles drawn by a computer with decent fidelity.  I'll likely start with simplified pictures then work towards increasing complexity. 

Stay tuned.
